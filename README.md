3.1 Prediction of Intern Recruitment Using Bayesian Network Aim or future work: Inside our Network, the final goal is to calculate the probability that a candidate will enter a tech company to be an intern. This will be affected by both candidates’ yearn for the position and company’s willingness to the candidate, and also, some other factors of emergency. • Bayesian Network Construction. o The network structure was built based on recruitment logic and data assumptions. o There are 12 key nodes (such as education level, interview performance, and compensation), represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to show causal relationships between them. • Inference Algorithms (Two algorithms) o Variable Elimination (VE): Used to iteratively eliminate irrelevant variables and calculate the posterior probability of the target variable. o Clique Tree Algorithm (Junction Tree): Efficiently infers joint probability distributions by constructing a tree structure. • User Interface (UI) o Designed an interactive interface where users can input relevant conditions (such as education level and interview performance) to see the predicted results. Users can also customize the Bayesian probabilities to observe how changes affect the outcomes.
